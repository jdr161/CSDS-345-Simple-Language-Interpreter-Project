1. Code blocks { } (M_block) (Maria and Wendy)
2. goto types: break, continue, (true) return, throw e; (continuation functions for all four) (James)
implement break for while loop 
return function for creating M_state
(for each of those type, can make interpreter tail recursive where only M_state function must be tail recursive, but will need M_value, M_integer and 
M_boolean functions tail recursive in part 3) or can use call/cc
3. Change return from a variable to a function?
4. State must be a list of layers (inside M_state) (Layers)
(top of layer here ----> work down) = state
5.M_state must be tail recursive using CPS (Maria)

6. Binding pairs from ((var value) (var value)) pairs to ((list of vars) (list of values))
I recommend either a list of binding pairs (for example: ((x 5) (y 12) ...) ), 
or two lists, one with the variables and one with the values (for example: ((x y ...) (5 12 ...))).
7. RECOMMENDED: Handle functions with side effect using box
